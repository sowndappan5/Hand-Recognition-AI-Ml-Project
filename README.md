## Introduction

Hand tracking is a crucial aspect of many computer vision applications, such as gesture recognition, sign language interpretation, and augmented reality. This project utilizes MediaPipe, a popular framework for building machine learning pipelines, to detect and track hands in real-time video streams.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand-tracking.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install mediapipe opencv-python
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the main script:

    ```bash
    python hand_tracking.py
    ```

2. Position your hands in front of the webcam.

3. The application will detect and track your hands in real-time.

4. If both hands are detected, it will display "Both Hands" on the screen.

5. If only one hand is detected, it will display whether it's the left or right hand.

6. Press 'q' to quit the application.
